# Linkspan Info

## Overview

The data in each of the files `result_PIP_GRT`, `_LOA`, `_Power`, and `_Speed` represent respectively the total number of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)[^1], Length Overall (LOA)[^2], engine power[^3], and speed[^4] of the total ships at each linkspan at each timestamp throughout 2023. The values were calculated using the [PIP Data](../PIP%20Data/).

The column headers refer to individual linkspans.

## Context

This data was collected to calculate ship features for predicting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and to analyze their effects.

## What might the data be useful for?

This data could be used for machine learning modelling, and linkspan activity visualisation and predictions. Data could also be corroborated with other data to estimate emissions output.

[^1]: Gross register tonnage or gross tonnage (GT) represents the total internal volume of cargo vessels. 1 GRT = 100 cubic feet â‰ˆ 2.83 cubic metres.
[^2]: Length overall (LOA, o/a, o.a. or oa) is the maximum length of a vessel's hull measured parallel to the waterline.
[^3]: In shipping, engine power, often measured in horsepower (HP) or kilowatts (kW). It is unclear on the surface which unit is represented in the data. This can be confirmed if needed!
[^4]: In shipping, speed is measured in knots (nautical miles per hour), and while container ships can reach speeds of up to 24 knots, larger bulk carriers typically travel around 15 knots, with factors like ship size, route, and weather conditions also influencing speed.
